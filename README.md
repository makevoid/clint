#### You probably shouldn't try using this in production, but, if you still find it useful for dev and easier than raw Plug, then:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lpil/clint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lpil/clint)

Clint is an Elixir web micro-framework, inspired by
[Sinatra](http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra), and built on top of
[Plug](http://github.com/elixir-lang/plug) and
[Cowboy](http://github.com/ninenines/cowboy).

Or at least that's the idea. We're not there yet. You probably shouldn't try
using this.

```elixir
defmodule App do
  use Clint

  get "/" do
    conn
    |> text("Hello world!")
  end
end
```
```
mix run -e App.start
```

## Usage

#### Reloading the app on changes

This'll happen, as soon as I work out how Elixir/Erlang code reloading works.
